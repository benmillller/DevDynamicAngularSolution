=========================

Extend angular in such a way that allow extending the module on the fly ie
it allow to add new service,directives,filters etc to a module that already been bootstrap , and rebind the module to the same dom tree.
in addition it add utility function that load html and scripts (usually with extra module elements) into the page. by using this extension to angular you can deferred loading parts of your application to future time.
